# FB chat data analysis
A Jupyter notebook with exploratory analysis of my Facebook Messenger chat data (and the scripts for extracting the data)
#### Running
The personal chat data of me and others has not been included for obvious reasons. A modified view of my analysis can be found in ```chat_analysis_edited.html```, which is also hosted [here.](http://kodu.ut.ee/~andreasv/Chat_analysis_edited.html)
To create your own full version, after downloading your own FB data ([instructions](https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467)) (change your FB language to English and the time format to 24h beforehand) , place the ```messages``` folder in it into the same folder as all the scripts, delete all subfolders of ```messages```, leaving only the html files, run ```scrape.py```, ```format.py```, open ```chat_analysis.ipynb``` and rerun all code blocks.
